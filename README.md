Okay, so the only glitch I can't quite nail down is recalling the localStorage back to the text boxes. As far as I can tell, my code is good despite being highly redundant. My apologies.

I started off with some very light pseudo-coding, just enough to get started. I knew I could get the time from the browser so I started with that. Then I created the rest of the main html/bootstrap layout. I really didn't have any trouble until I tried to change the colors of the text boxes based on the current hour. Turns out I needed to stop treating them like a group, and treat them like individuals. 

John helped me get that segment working which was awesome. I then spent the following 6 hours trying to get local storage to work in a non-redundant way. I couldn't because of my html unfortunately. I decided to just go with the redundant method since I didn't quite feel like scrapping my html and doing dynamic JS again. 

At least not at the moment, I may revisit later for a better grade if this is crap.
