## Day Scheduler:
 What I created was a very simple, time based reminder tool. It only works  for the current day but all reminders will carry over to the next if they  are saved.
 
## Breakdown:
 1. Type anything you would like to remember into a time slot.
 2. Click the save button to keep the reminder.
 3. As time progresses the background color of the time slots will change depending on the current hour.
 4. To clear a reminder, simple erase it and hit the save button.
